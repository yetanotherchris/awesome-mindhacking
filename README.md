# awesome-mindhacking 

A curated list of mind hacking related resources.

## Background

Using the theme of the [awesome](https://github.com/topics/awesome) lists and topic, this is a list of resources in the spirit of the [Mindhacking book](http://mindhacki.ng) and promotion of good mental health in general.

## General

1. [Mindhacking by John Hargrave](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/jhargrave/mind-hacking/details) - the book covers many topics including mindfulness.
1. [The Brain at work by David Rock](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Your-Brain-Work-Strategies-Distraction/dp/0061771295) - working hacks and neuroscience research. 
1. [Your Memory by Kenneth Higbee](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Your-Brain-Work-Strategies-Distraction/dp/0061771295) - essential reading if you're studying and learning something new.
1. [Teach Yourself CBT](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cognitive-Behavioural-Therapy-Evidence-based-goal-oriented/dp/1473607922/) - a lot of the Mindhacking book and technique borrows techniques from CBT, but packages the CBT triangle into a slightly more evolved METAL format. This book is probably the easiest and most accessible CBT book.
1. [Introduction to Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) Udemy, free](https://www.udemy.com/neuro-linguistic-programming-nlp-course-introduction-achology/) - The Mindhacking book has some techniques that NLP tutors might recognise. This video course is a good intro to NLP and is entertaining throughout.

## Mindfulness and Meditation

1. [You're It by Alan Watts](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Youre-It-Audiobook/B004F4JTPE) - focused on philosophy of mind and some meditation.
1. [The art of Presence by Eckhart Tolle](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/The-Art-of-Presence-Audiobook/B004F4LAN8) - similar to Alan Watts he focuses on mindfulness. All his work is good and worth listening to.
1. [Headspace](http://www.headspace.com) - still the best meditation app in my view, and worth the subscription.
1. [Mindfulness for Beginners by Jon Kabat-Zinn](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mindfulness-Beginners-Jon-Kabat-Zinn/dp/1591794641) - light hearted look at mindfulness similar to Ekhart Tolle's audiobooks.
1. [Mindfulness a Practical Guide by Mark Williams](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mindfulness-practical-guide-finding-frantic/dp/074995308X/) is a very gentle mindfulness book and course, which is as the author explains is used with patients at a medical center in the UK.
1. [Awareness by Anthony De Mello](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Awareness.html?id=w1nac6qAoO8C&redir_esc=y) is a great book  in a similar vein to Alan Watts and Eckhart Tolle, if slightly Guru-ish in places.

## Nutrition

1. [5-2 diet](https://the5-2dietbook.com/basics) - lots of research behind this fasting diet shows its benefits. If you do it for just a day you might change your outlook on food.
1. Kevin Rose also has a fast tracking app available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zerofasting.zero&hl=en_US) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zero-fasting-tracker/id1168348542).
1. [Ketogenic diet](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/) - low carb diet with the goal of entering ketosis. Has a growing wealth of research around its benefits.
1. [Rhonda Patrick's Macronutrient Smoothie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys86ZgjQQYg) - expensive set of ingredients but variations of it work just as well.
1. [Rhonda Patrick](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/) - both her podcast and youtube videos are full of cutting edge research.
1. [Several Joe Rogan podcast guests](https://www.jrepodcast.com/episodes/food-nutrition/) have focused on nutrition and longevity research.

1. [Kimchee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sX_wDCbeuU) - known for its probiotic effects. It's essentially cabbage, onion, radish, carrots in a salt, 1ugar and chilli brine, left to ferment for a week.
1. Kefir - known for its probiotic effects. You can buy it from supermarkets and is similar to probiotic yoghurt.
1. [High fibre superfoods](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/10-superfoods-to-boost-a-healthy-diet-2018082914463) - tick the probiotic box as well as having their own benefits from the fibre and extra macronutrients you're digesting.
1. The fast mimicking diet has some evidence pointing to its health benefits, including research showing its effectiveness during chemotherapy. [Voltar Longon](https://valterlongo.com/biography/) is one expert on the topic. This diet involves only eating during a "window" in the day, usually 8-10 hours.

## Nootropics

This could be a readme in itself. Nootropics are supplements aimed increasing brain function in some way, typically to increase your brain performance. Some good resources can be found on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/).

[Dave Asprey](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dave+asprey) is a good place to start for this.

As far as vitamins are concerned, the most commonly recommended supplements are:
- A multi-vitamin with A, B and C
- Double or more dosage of the RDA for Vitamin D (Rhonda Patrick talks about this a lot).
- A probiotic.
- An Omega 3 and 6 supplement, in equal measures. Chia Seeds or Fish Oil offer 3 in abudence, nuts and seeds for 6.

## Exercise

As the Mindhacking book described, exercise is important to build into your daily life.

1. [Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeXz8fIZDCE) - is an essential if you have a desk job. It's worth doing at a class so you're forced to do it for a set amount of time rather than at home. 
1. [Trigger Point Therapy Workbook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trigger-Point-Therapy-Workbook-Self-Treatment/dp/1608824942/) - if you do a lot of exercise or just injure yourself this is good self-help book for deep-tissue style self-massage.
1. [Park Runs - for UK runners only](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/) - a free well organised run every Saturday in various park locations.
1. [Four hour Body by Tim Ferris](https://www.amazon.co.uk/4-Hour-Body-Uncommon-Incredible-Superhuman/dp/0091939526) - excellent book focused on finding exercises with the most effect in the shortest period of time.
1. [Sauna research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NChyDtupmkk) has recently shown benefits in reducing strokes.
